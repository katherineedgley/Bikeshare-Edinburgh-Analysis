# Bikeshare-Edinburgh-Analysis
Investigation of Edinburgh JustEat Cycles open data, specifically during Covid-19
(Still in progress)

# Installations
Python 3.\*. Also require Pyproj package.

# Project Motivation
Look at trends in bicycle data in the city of Edinburgh resulting from the Covid-19 lockdown. 
Have people been biking more or less during the lockdown?
Can we see a reduction in commuting with the public bikes?
Can we see which kinds of people are generally still commuting on the bikes?

# File descriptions
`Bike_Analysis_Edinburgh.ipynb` is a notebook containing the bulk of the data exploration and visualisation. `load_data.ipynb` is the notebook responsible for the data loading, directly from the Just Eat Cycles website, and data cleaning. It is called to load the clean data into the other exploratory notebooks.
